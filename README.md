# Design and Specification

This is a repo to contain design and specification decisions in the base version of KVCG and any design and speicification decisions that groups want to share for their work.

The idea behind this is to promote collaboration and allow for clear reasoning about properties such as consistency, availibility, and fault-tolerance along with performance.

Look at Example.md to get an idea on what could be useful to have in one of these documents.
